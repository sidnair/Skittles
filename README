Some notes:
- distributions are uniform per player, not for a bag

Testing stuff:
  Here's how to run stuff:
  1) run everything from the root directory of the repo.
  2) run scripts/install-hooks.sh to set the pre-commit script to run on commit.
  You'll need to run it again if the pre-commit script is changed.
  3) You can run scripts/pre-commit if you want to check if you'd pass the
  regression test without committing.
  4) To add tests, you just add a config file to configs/. Run
  scripts/clean-tests.sh to remove the old results. Use descriptive names.
  GameConfig.xml is just a dumb example.

  Notes:
  1) It says there's a regression if you score under 0 even if it's a higher
  score than before.
  2) If it's failing too often because of random variation, change threshold in
  the results analyzer.
  3) If you get an error about old and new scores not being aligned, you
  probably need to run scripts/clean-tests.sh.
  4) If the hook is preventing you from submitting an important commit, run it
  with the \--no-verify option (http://book.git-scm.com/5_git_hooks.html)
